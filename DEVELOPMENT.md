# Development

4/19 - Wrote the start of classes to represent Interval and Pitch, using previously written
python code as a reference.

4/20 - Finished writing stripped-down versions of Interval and Pitch and wrote a class to represent Scales.
My program can now create scales given a starting note and scale type, although some notes are enharmonically wrong.
